## Simple Linear Regression

### Dataset Generation:
- 100 random Xs are generated, and corresponding Ys are modeled based on Y = 2 + 3X + ε, where ε ~ N(0, 1).

### Data Splitting:
- The dataset is randomly split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set.

### Model Fitting:
- The Simple Regression line (Least Squares Line) is identified using the training set.

### Model Testing:
- Model performance is assessed on the testing set.
- Residual Standard Error (RSE) and R² statistic are calculated and reported.

### Visualization:
- Dataset points are plotted, along with the Population Regression Line (in red) and the Least Squares Line (in blue).
